# Car-Performance-Calculator

The Car Performance Calculator is the first of its kind by LaunchPad Racing, an F1 in Schools team.

When I created this app, it was with the intention of allowing smaller F1 in Schools teams without access to sufficient high quality testing software: a free, accurate way to test out and compare different variants of their car design. In this, I used an algorithm involving terminal velocity, taking into account the frontal area of the car, and an estimate drag and drag-coefficient from the variables provided, in order to create simulated results of the car's performance during the race along with dynamic motion graphs. Here, I used OpenCV JS, an image processing library, and the HighCharts Library as the main components in this JavaScript Application. When comparing this program with real-life testing, we saw results within the limits of experimental accuracy - 5% at maximum and the majority of tests resulted in results perfect to 3 decimal places (100 tests conducted)

The source code for this app is available here for people to see how I created this with such few inputs - and I hope even more people can use this to further their performance.

UPDATE: I am happy to announce that we have recently crossed 150 unique users who have input their car, from over 11 countries as the software has received credibility and positive judgement from Peter of Infinitude Racing, the world-record holders in the competition. We hope this continues to be of use for years to come.
